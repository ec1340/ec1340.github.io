I love building and learning. I'm currently building the future of molecule intelligence @ [Ascent Bio](https://www.ascentbio.xyz/)

### A Little About Me
 
I recently completed my PhD in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Yale University in [Dr.Smita Krishnaswamy's lab](https://www.krishnaswamylab.org/). I enjoy thinking across disciplines and learning how machine learning can improve our understanding of biomolecular structure and function.
Before graduate school, I interned at Genentech applying machine learning to internal chemical data for property prediction. I majored in Pharmacological Chemistry with a minor in Mathematics at UC San Diego, where I conducted research in the [Amaro Lab](https://amarolab.ucsd.edu/) and [Walker Lab](http://www.rosswalker.co.uk).
